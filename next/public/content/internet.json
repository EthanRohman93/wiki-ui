      "p": "The foundational technology of the Internet, including the concept of packet switching, was developed in the 1960s. The first practical schematics for the Internet would not arrive until the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, which initially connected four major computers at universities in the southwestern US. Over the decades, the network expanded globally and incorporated a range of new technologies."

      "h": "Key Technologies and Protocols",
      "p": "The operation of the Internet relies on a set of standardized protocols, the most important of which are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), collectively known as TCP/IP. These protocols manage the transmission of data over the network. Other foundational technologies include the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names to IP addresses, and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which facilitates the web browsing experience."
