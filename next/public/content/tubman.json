      "p": "Harriet Tubman, born Araminta Ross in circa 1822, was an American abolitionist and political activist. Born into slavery in Maryland, Tubman escaped to freedom in the North in 1849 but returned many times to rescue both family members and non-relatives from the plantation system. She is most famous for her role as a conductor on the Underground Railroad, a network of secret routes and safe houses used to help enslaved African Americans escape into free states and Canada."

      "h": "Early Life and Escape",
      "p": "Harriet Tubman was born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where she experienced harsh conditions and violence from a young age. In 1849, fearing a sale to the Deep South, Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, declaring, 'When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.'"

      "h": "Role in the Underground Railroad",
      "p": "After her escape, Tubman risked her life to lead approximately 70 slaves to freedom over 13 missions, using the network known as the Underground Railroad. She employed clever tactics to evade capture and never lost a passenger. Tubman's deep religious faith inspired her, and she was known as 'Moses' to many who knew her story."

      "h": "Later Life and Legacy",
      "p": "Beyond her work with the Underground Railroad, Tubman served as a scout, spy, guerrilla soldier, and nurse for the Union Army during the Civil War. After the war, she dedicated her life to helping impoverished former slaves and the elderly, establishing the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged in Auburn, New York, where she later died in 1913. Her legacy as a pioneer in civil rights and her unyielding commitment to fighting for equality and justice live on today."
